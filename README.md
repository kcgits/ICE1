# ICE1
This repository is for my completed ICE1 assignment. I have somehow managed to mess up my local repository, or something along those lines within my 
netbeans or computer because when i try to commit either my master or my local branch, it is commiting the first assignment we did in class, even though im
not attempting to push or commit it. That is why in this repository you see the Student Project AS WELL AS my Card/CardTrick project. I dont know how I can
fix this but hope either you will be able to help me out or I can find a tutor to help me because it caused alot of frustration and made me take alot more 
time to complete this than it should have. 

Either way I still did manage to complete the assignment and hope everything is to your liking. Thank you Professor
